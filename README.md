# 8_digit_vfd

This library is for my 8 digit display using Russian IV-4 tubes, which are 16 segment per digit. The tubes are driven by 5 Maxim MAX6934A ICs and the assembly includes all voltages (25V, 5V, 2.6V, and -5V) needed from a single 12V DC input.

v1.0.0 was written to work with Teensy 3.2 without any intention of widening the compatibility to other boards in the near future. Basically, I have a stockpile of Teensy 3.2s and until they're gone I'm not complicating things by trying to do more codes.

DISCLAIMER: I'm not a professional software developer/engineer. My education is in electronics hardware and I just scrape by when software is needed, I'm sure many of you will be able to improve on this code and/or provide a better solution. If so, please drop me a line so I can check it out.
